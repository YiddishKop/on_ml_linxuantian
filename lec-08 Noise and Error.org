#+TITLE: lec-08 Noise and Error
* Noise and Probabilistic Target
can replace f(x) by P(y|x)
*** recap: the learning flow
*** noise
*** probabilistic marbles
*** target distribution P(y|X)
*** the new learning flow
*** fun time
* Error Measure
affect ‘ideal’ target
*** error measure
*** pointwise error measure
*** two important pointwise error measure
*** ideal mini-target
*** learning flow with error measure
*** fun time
* Algorithmic Error Measure
user-dependent ==> plausible or friendly
*** choice of error measure
*** fingerprint verification for supermarket
*** fingerprint verification for CIA
*** take-home message for now
*** learning flow with algorithmic error measure
*** fun time
* Weighted Classification
easily done by virtual ‘example copying’
*** weighted classification
*** minimizing Ein for weighted classification
*** systematic route: connect Einw and Ein0/1
*** weighted pocket algorithm
*** fun time
